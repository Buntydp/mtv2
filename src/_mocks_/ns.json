We also believe in the power of data science and machine learning to make car insurance better and less complicated. \n\nBy using our deep understanding of data and building services that make having a car less expensive, more convenient, and smarter, we aim to make the urban car experience truly simple. And for some, we hope to make car ownership a possibility where it wasn’t before. \n\nMetromile has raised approximately $291 million in funding (Series A through E) and are backed by top tier Silicon Valley Investors including NEA, Index and First Round Capital.",

Today, more than 17,000 team members work for our suite of fintech services. Together with nearly 100 brands across a broad range of industries, from real estate to sports, we make up the Rock Family of Companies – all united by an obsession to find a better way for our clients, our team members and our communities.\n\n\tWe say that we’re obsessed, but it’s more than that – it’s our purpose and guiding light. Finding a better way is the only way. The results speak for themselves:\n\n•\tWe were the first lender to bring the entire mortgage process online.\n•\tFor 9 years in a row now, J.D. Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the sixth year in a row, they also ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.\n•\tWe build advanced technology that improves our clients’ lives, including voice assistant integrations that make it possible to pay your mortgage simply using your voice.\n\nThis success wouldn’t be possible without our team members. It’s because of their drive and determination that we’ve made the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s annual ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 15 consecutive years. But awards can’t replace great ideas. That’s why we’re committed to an inclusive workplace, where every voice is heard and all our team members have access and opportunity to grow their skills and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nThat mission extends out beyond our walls and right into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest our unique efforts in ways that impact the world around us. \n\nWe’ve revolutionized the mortgage industry, but this is about more than mortgages. This is about changing people’s lives. Join our team and change your own life today.\n\n\nBased on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.\n\nFor J.D.

Whether you’re helping our clients navigate the complicated home buying process or developing the latest game-changing financial products, you join an organization that is changing the face of lending – just as we have for more than 30 years.\n\n\tWhat started simply as a summer experiment for our founder and chairman Dan Gilbert has become America’s largest mortgage lender,1 with offices in Detroit, Cleveland, Phoenix, Charlotte and more. Today, more than 17,000 team members work for our suite of fintech services. Together with nearly 100 brands across a broad range of industries, from real estate to sports, we make up the Rock Family of Companies – all united by an obsession to find a better way for our clients, our team members and our communities.\n\n\tWe say that we’re obsessed, but it’s more than that – it’s our purpose and guiding light. Finding a better way is the only way. The results speak for themselves:\n\n•\tWe were the first lender to bring the entire mortgage process online.\n•\tFor 9 years in a row now, J.D. Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the sixth year in a row, they also ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.\n•\tWe build advanced technology that improves our clients’ lives, including voice assistant integrations that make it possible to pay your mortgage simply using your voice.\n\nThis success wouldn’t be possible without our team members. It’s because of their drive and determination that we’ve made the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s annual ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 15 consecutive years. But awards can’t replace great ideas. That’s why we’re committed to an inclusive workplace, where every voice is heard and all our team members have access and opportunity to grow their skills and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nThat mission extends out beyond our walls and right into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest our unique efforts in ways that impact the world around us. \n\nWe’ve revolutionized the mortgage industry, but this is about more than mortgages. This is about changing people’s lives. Join our team and change your own life today.\n\n\nBased on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.\n\nFor J.D.

Brandon and Clint founded GoHealth, a company that revolutionized the health insurance shopping process – and the health care industry as a whole. While the future of the health care industry is ever-changing, our focus and determination has remained razor-sharp. As our customers evolve, as their needs continue to change and adjust, so does GoHealth.\n\nEveryone who is a part of GoHealth understands the importance of what we do every day.

Whether you’re helping our clients navigate the complicated home buying process or developing the latest game-changing financial products, you join an organization that is changing the face of lending – just as we have for more than 30 years.\n\n\tWhat started simply as a summer experiment for our founder and chairman Dan Gilbert has become America’s largest mortgage lender,1 with offices in Detroit, Cleveland, Phoenix, Charlotte and more. Today, more than 17,000 team members work for our suite of fintech services. Together with nearly 100 brands across a broad range of industries, from real estate to sports, we make up the Rock Family of Companies – all united by an obsession to find a better way for our clients, our team members and our communities.\n\n\tWe say that we’re obsessed, but it’s more than that – it’s our purpose and guiding light. Finding a better way is the only way. The results speak for themselves:\n\n•\tWe were the first lender to bring the entire mortgage process online.\n•\tFor 9 years in a row now, J.D. Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the sixth year in a row, they also ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.\n•\tWe build advanced technology that improves our clients’ lives, including voice assistant integrations that make it possible to pay your mortgage simply using your voice.\n\nThis success wouldn’t be possible without our team members. It’s because of their drive and determination that we’ve made the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s annual ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 15 consecutive years. But awards can’t replace great ideas. That’s why we’re committed to an inclusive workplace, where every voice is heard and all our team members have access and opportunity to grow their skills and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nThat mission extends out beyond our walls and right into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest our unique efforts in ways that impact the world around us. \n\nWe’ve revolutionized the mortgage industry, but this is about more than mortgages. This is about changing people’s lives. Join our team and change your own life today.\n\n\nBased on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.\n\nFor J.D.

Given its essential role, we believe mRNA could be used to create a new category of medicines with significant potential to improve the lives of patients.\n\nWe are pioneering a new class of medicines made of messenger RNA, or mRNA. The potential implications of using mRNA as a drug are significant and far-reaching and could meaningfully improve how medicines are discovered, developed and manufactured. \n\nSince our founding in 2010, we have worked to build the industry's leading mRNA technology platform, the infrastructure to accelerate drug discovery and early development, a rapidly expanding pipeline, and a world-class team. Our pipeline includes development candidates for mRNA-based vaccines and therapies spanning several therapeutic areas, and we have multiple clinical trials underway with other development candidates progressing toward the clinic. In addition, we have numerous discovery programs advancing toward development.",

Inspired by the values of human dignity, individual empowerment, and equitable access to care. And they came together to build a community health movement across Massachusetts. \n\nThe goal was to support the primary care physician, using an integrated team of nurse practitioners, nurses, behavioral health professionals, social services providers, and other professionals.\n\nThese combined efforts were the genesis of Commonwealth Care Alliance. Since our founding in 2003, we have remained committed to three main objectives:\n\n• Enhancing quality of life through better health and greater independence\n• Transforming care delivery by focusing on the most complex cases, defining new clinical best practices, and lowering the cost of care\n• Reducing health disparities by expanding access to exceptional care, and increasing the return on investment on care for those who need it most",

Whether you’re helping our clients navigate the complicated home buying process or developing the latest game-changing financial products, you join an organization that is changing the face of lending – just as we have for more than 30 years.\n\n\tWhat started simply as a summer experiment for our founder and chairman Dan Gilbert has become America’s largest mortgage lender,1 with offices in Detroit, Cleveland, Phoenix, Charlotte and more.

Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the sixth year in a row, they also ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.\n•\tWe build advanced technology that improves our clients’ lives, including voice assistant integrations that make it possible to pay your mortgage simply using your voice.\n\nThis success wouldn’t be possible without our team members. It’s because of their drive and determination that we’ve made the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s annual ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 15 consecutive years. But awards can’t replace great ideas. That’s why we’re committed to an inclusive workplace, where every voice is heard and all our team members have access and opportunity to grow their skills and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nThat mission extends out beyond our walls and right into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest our unique efforts in ways that impact the world around us. \n\nWe’ve revolutionized the mortgage industry, but this is about more than mortgages.

The potential implications of using mRNA as a drug are significant and far-reaching and could meaningfully improve how medicines are discovered, developed and manufactured. \n\nSince our founding in 2010, we have worked to build the industry's leading mRNA technology platform, the infrastructure to accelerate drug discovery and early development, a rapidly expanding pipeline, and a world-class team.

Whether you’re helping our clients navigate the complicated home buying process or developing the latest game-changing financial products, you join an organization that is changing the face of lending – just as we have for more than 30 years.\n\n\tWhat started simply as a summer experiment for our founder and chairman Dan Gilbert has become America’s largest mortgage lender,1 with offices in Detroit, Cleveland, Phoenix, Charlotte and more. Today, more than 17,000 team members work for our suite of fintech services. Together with nearly 100 brands across a broad range of industries, from real estate to sports, we make up the Rock Family of Companies – all united by an obsession to find a better way for our clients, our team members and our communities.\n\n\tWe say that we’re obsessed, but it’s more than that – it’s our purpose and guiding light. Finding a better way is the only way. The results speak for themselves:\n\n•\tWe were the first lender to bring the entire mortgage process online.\n•\tFor 9 years in a row now, J.D. Power has ranked Quicken Loans highest in the nation in customer satisfaction for Primary Mortgage Origination. And for the sixth year in a row, they also ranked us highest for Mortgage Servicing.\n•\tWe build advanced technology that improves our clients’ lives, including voice assistant integrations that make it possible to pay your mortgage simply using your voice.\n\nThis success wouldn’t be possible without our team members. It’s because of their drive and determination that we’ve made the top-30 of FORTUNE magazine’s annual ranking of the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for 15 consecutive years. But awards can’t replace great ideas. That’s why we’re committed to an inclusive workplace, where every voice is heard and all our team members have access and opportunity to grow their skills and become the best versions of themselves.\n\nThat mission extends out beyond our walls and right into our communities, where we don’t just volunteer but also invest our unique efforts in ways that impact the world around us. \n\nWe’ve revolutionized the mortgage industry, but this is about more than mortgages. This is about changing people’s lives. Join our team and change your own life today.\n\n\nBased on Quicken Loans data in comparison to public data records.\n\nFor J.D.

The potential implications of using mRNA as a drug are significant and far-reaching and could meaningfully improve how medicines are discovered, developed and manufactured. \n\nSince our founding in 2010, we have worked to build the industry's leading mRNA technology platform, the infrastructure to accelerate drug discovery and early development, a rapidly expanding pipeline, and a world-class team. Our pipeline includes development candidates for mRNA-based vaccines and therapies spanning several therapeutic areas, and we have multiple clinical trials underway with other development candidates progressing toward the clinic. In addition, we have numerous discovery programs advancing toward development.",
